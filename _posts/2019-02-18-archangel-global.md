The second major user trial of the ARCHANGEL platform has gone live today in an international deployment!  We have created the first international blockchain to secure the integrity of public digital archives, across the National Archives of the United Kingdom, Estonia, Norway and Australia.  Several further archives are interested in signing up so watch this space to see how they get on!
