Following trials of several DLT platforms we have adopted Ethereum for the ARCHANGEL project and built a prototype system around the first use case of the project focusing on secure research data.  The prototype will be trialed next month in an invitation-only workshop held at the University of Surrey convening archivists and experts in research data managment from across the UK.
