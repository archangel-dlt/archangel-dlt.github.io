The Archangel DLT Demonstration application is now available online -

   * Blockchains and other distributed ledger technologies have generated significant interest in recent years. This interest, as with many emerging technologies, seems to conform to the Gartner Hype Cycle. In the face of this hype, the ODI has tried to provide some reasoned input about the many promises of these new technologies.

 * [ARCHANGEL: Trusted Archives of Digital Public Documents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08342) 
   * We present ARCHANGEL; a de-centralised platform for ensuring the long-term integrity of digital documents stored within public archives. Document integrity is fundamental to public trust in archives. Yet currently that trust is built upon institutional reputation â€” trust at face value in a centralised authority, like a national government archive or University. ARCHANGEL proposes a shift to a technological underscoring of that trust, using distributed ledger technology (DLT) to cryptographically guarantee the provenance, immutability and so the integrity of archived documents. We describe the ARCHANGEL architecture, and report on a prototype of that architecture build over the Ethereum infrastructure. We report early evaluation and feedback of ARCHANGEL from stakeholders in the research data archives space.
