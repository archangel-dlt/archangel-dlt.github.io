We're in the process of deploying a private Proof-of-Authority Ethereum network for Archangel.

The network currently consists of a bootnode and just two sealing notes.  The Archangel smart contract isn't yet deployed, so the Web Demo still operates against the Rinkeby test network at the moment.

There is, however, a [network monitor](http://139.162.253.192:90/) available, and you can deploy a client node on Unix-like host using using our [tools](https://github.com/archangel-dlt/archangel-ethereum-network).
