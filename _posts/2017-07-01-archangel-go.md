The ARCHANGEL project officially kicks off today, following successful funding proposal to the UKRI/EPSRC Digital Economy Programme’s Applications of Distributed Ledger Technology (ADLT) call.  ARCHANGEL will explore ways to fingerprint digital records and store those fingerprints in a Blockchain – a kind of tamper-proof database maintained by many organisations (such as national archives).  This will enable archives to prove the integrity and provenance of their records.  ARCHANGEL is more than a technology project – it will work closely with archives in the UK and abroad to study how this technology can transform archival practice for the digital age.  ARCHANGEL is a 2 year project funded by the EPSRC and uniting expertise from the University of Surrey, Tim Berners-Lee’s Open Data Institute, and The National Archives. https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/P03151X/1
