A technical paper documenting the first prototype of the ARCHANGEL system for securing University research data archives was presented at the prestigious international conference ACM Document Engineering by Dr Olivier Thereaux of the Open Data Institute (ODI).  It not only documents the platform but contains reflections from archivists who tried out the system at the Surrey workshop earlier this year.
