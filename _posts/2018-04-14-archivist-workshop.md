The first user facing trial of ARCHANGEL has taken place today at the University of Surrey, in a meeting of 17 archivists and experts in digital record keeping.  The workshop not only trialed the initial version of the ARCHANGEL platform but gathered archivist practice-led perspectives on the value proposition of ARCHANGEL and how it could integrate to their existing workflows.
